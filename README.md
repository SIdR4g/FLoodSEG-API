# FloodSEG API

## Overview
The Floodseg API is a powerful tool designed for precise flood monitoring using advanced image segmentation techniques. Leveraging technologies such as PyTorch, OpenCV, and the DeepLabV3 model, this API provides accurate segmentation of flood-affected areas from input images. Additionally, it offers user registration, login functionalities, and secure authentication through JSON Web Tokens (JWT). An innovative feature allows users to submit fragmented images of the same flood-prone region, and the API intelligently stitches these segments post-segmentation, providing high-resolution, comprehensive visuals for enhanced flood monitoring.

## Features
1. **Image Segmentation:**
   - Utilizes PyTorch and DeepLabV3 for accurate segmentation of flood-affected areas from input images.
   - Employs OpenCV for post-processing, ensuring precise and detailed results.

2. **User Authentication:**
   - Seamless registration and login functionalities for user access.
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) ensure secure and confidential authentication.

3. **High-Resolution Image Stitching:**
   - Unique feature allows users to submit fragmented images of the same flood-prone region.
   - API intelligently stitches these segments post-segmentation, delivering high-resolution, comprehensive visuals.
